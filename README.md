# Garrett's dotfiles

This repository contains personal workstation configuration for macOS and
Debian 13.

The repository is designed to live at `~/.dotfiles`. The top-level application
folders are the source of truth. The installer creates links to the individual
files and subfolders that each application needs; it does not link every
source folder as a whole.

## Configuration folders

These folders contain application configuration, not installer logic.

| Folder          | Contents                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `arc/`          | Arc's `StorableLinkRouting.json`. It stores Arc Space IDs and is used on macOS.                 |
| `codex/.codex/` | Personal Codex configuration and keybindings.                                                   |
| `ghostty/`      | Ghostty config and the light and dark generated themes.                                         |
| `images/`       | Shared Tux artwork and other installer assets.                                                  |
| `karabiner/`    | Karabiner-Elements keyboard remapping rules.                                                    |
| `nvim/`         | Neovim entry point, options, keymaps, plugin setup, and plugins.                                |
| `opencode/`     | OpenCode config, TUI settings, and generated themes.                                            |
| `superfile/`    | Superfile config and generated theme.                                                           |
| `tmux/`         | tmux configuration.                                                                             |
| `vscode/user/`  | Editor settings, keybindings, and extensions for VS Code or VSCodium.                           |
| `zsh/`          | `.zshenv`, `.zprofile`, and `.zshrc`. The installer links these into the user's home directory. |

Themes in these folders are outputs. Edit the shared theme tokens and generator
when a theme needs to change; do not make a one-off edit to only one generated
theme file.

## Packages

`packages/` contains code that installs, generates, or extends the dotfiles.
Each package has a separate responsibility.

### `packages/installer/`

The machine installer is the only supported installation entry point. Its
important folders are:

```text
packages/installer/
├── install.sh       Entry point for full, phase, and single-strategy installs
├── setup/            OS-aware setup strategies, grouped by install phase
├── config/           Configuration owned by the installer
├── lib/              Installer-only Bash helpers
├── packages/         Package retirement data and schema
└── tests/            Tests that mirror install.sh, setup/, and lib/
```

Run the installer from a clean machine or disposable test VM. Do not run files
under `packages/installer/setup/` directly.

See [`packages/installer/README.md`](packages/installer/README.md) for the
install phases, supported systems, link behavior, and platform details. See
[`packages/installer/TESTING.md`](packages/installer/TESTING.md) for VM testing.

### `packages/lib/`

Shared libraries are independent of the installer.

- `packages/lib/bash/` contains reusable Bash libraries and cross-platform
  command-line tools. The `bin/` folder is for standalone tools.
- `packages/lib/ts/` is reserved for shared TypeScript. It is empty except for
  `.gitkeep` until shared code is added.

Installer-only helpers stay in `packages/installer/lib/`. This keeps the shared
library usable by other packages.

### `packages/mac/`

macOS-only tools live here. This includes small window, Dock, Finder, Ghostty,
and browser helpers, plus the canonical `mactop` source.

`packages/mac/mactop/` is an independent Go application. It monitors Apple
Silicon system resources and provides terminal, menu bar, overlay, and headless
interfaces. The installer builds this source for the machine. See its
[README](packages/mac/mactop/README.md) for build, configuration, and fan
control details.

### `packages/raycast/`

This folder contains Raycast extensions. Each direct child with a
`package.json` is one extension, for example:

- `better-screen-sharing/` opens and focuses Apple Screen Sharing connections.
- `better-time/` views and copies Unix millisecond timestamps.

[`packages/raycast/run.sh`](packages/raycast/run.sh) runs install, development,
build, test, typecheck, and format checks across all extensions.

### `packages/theming/`

This package owns the shared theme pipeline:

```text
packages/theming/create/tokens.css
        │
        ▼
packages/theming/create/controller.ts
        │
        ├── packages/theming/output/ghostty/
        ├── packages/theming/output/nvim/
        ├── packages/theming/output/oh-my-zsh/
        ├── packages/theming/output/opencode/
        ├── packages/theming/output/superfile/
        └── packages/theming/output/vscode/
```

The theme install phase copies or links the generated output to the
application configuration folders and builds the VS Code theme package in
`packages/theming/vsce-package/`. The detailed generator diagram is in
[`packages/theming/create/README.md`](packages/theming/create/README.md).

### `packages/vscode-ext/`

This is the source for the private `better-vscode` extension. The current
feature, `better-errors`, turns editor diagnostics into prompts that can be
copied for an LLM. Source is under `src/`, tests are under `test/`, and
extension documentation is under `docs/`.

### `packages/agent-usage/`

This TypeScript CLI reads the usage limits already stored by supported coding
agent CLIs and prints the remaining subscription usage. Its source is split
into `src/cli/`, `src/domain/`, and `src/providers/`; tests are in `tests/`.
The package does not store provider credentials.

## Dependency boundaries

The package layout is intentional:

```text
packages/lib/bash ─┐
packages/lib/ts   ─┼──> packages/mac
                  ├──> packages/raycast
                  ├──> packages/theming
                  └──> packages/vscode-ext

packages/installer ───> any lower-level package when it installs/configures it
```

Nothing depends on `packages/installer`. Reusable Bash code belongs in
`packages/lib/bash`; OS validation and package-install logic belong in the
installer. Mac-only tools belong in `packages/mac`.

## Installation

Clone this repository to the required path, then use the root commands or the
installer entry point:

```bash
git clone <repository-url> ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
npm ci

npm run install:machine       # Full machine setup
npm run install:apps          # Applications phase
npm run install:development  # Development tools and settings
npm run install:theme         # Generate and install application themes
npm run install:agents        # Link shared agent instructions and skills
```

The root `install:*` commands are thin wrappers around
`packages/installer/install.sh`. Use that script for other phases or when a
flag is not exposed by the root package scripts.

The installer supports macOS and Debian 13 (trixie). Linux requires an Xfce,
LightDM, and X11 installation prepared before the dotfiles installer runs.
The installer asks for a machine name and color during a full install and
writes the result to the local, ignored `machine.json` file.

## Development commands

Run commands from the repository root unless a package README says otherwise.

```bash
npm run lint              # Check JavaScript and TypeScript
npm run format:check      # Check formatting
npm run typecheck         # Check referenced TypeScript projects
npm run install:test      # Check installer structure and shared libraries
npm run verify:machine    # Check links after a machine install
npm run test:mactop       # Test the Go mactop application
npm run test:agent-usage  # Test the agent-usage CLI
npm run raycast check     # Test all Raycast extensions
```

Installer changes need the checks in
[`packages/installer/TESTING.md`](packages/installer/TESTING.md). Full machine
tests run in disposable UTM clones, not on the main workstation.

## Working rules

- Keep the repository at `~/.dotfiles` when testing installation.
- Change shared theme inputs in `packages/theming/create/`, then regenerate
  outputs through the theme install flow.
- Add reusable cross-platform Bash code to `packages/lib/bash/`.
- Keep installer-specific code in `packages/installer/`.
- Keep tests beside the package or feature that they cover.
- Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) before changing repository structure.
